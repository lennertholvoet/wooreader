# Wooreader
## Show digital content to users who bought the corresponding item in the WooCommerce Webshop
## Work In Progress 
This plugin is a work in progress, and only tested on a local machine.
Though I plan to advance quickly in development, all commits until a version 1.0 is released are not adviced to install on a production Wordpress site.
Code is messy now, since I'm getting accustomed with Wordpress Plugin Development. So the plan is to first, get a working version, and then clean up the spaghetti towards version 1.0, whick will be released in a public repository.
## Yet another Wordpress Plugin
WooReader is a plugin to show digital files on your website to user who purchased something via your WooCommerce shop.
These files could be one on one for a digtal sale, but also to give extra documents to customers who purchased a fysical work.
